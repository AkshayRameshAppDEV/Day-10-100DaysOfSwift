# Day 10

## Learnt the following:

## Classes and Inheritence:

### 1. Classes 
  - Should be marked with class keyword
  - create your own `init` initializer mandatory
  - `self.propertyName` referring to current instance property
  
### 2. Inheritence
  - Create a Main Parent Class - Super class
  - Create a new class (subclass) and inherit from the super class
  - All the main classe's properties and methods are inherited
  - `class classname: SuperClass`
  - The subclass can have its own initializer or call the super class initializer via `super.init()`

### 3. Overriding Methods
  - new implementations of existing parent class methods - usually prefixed by override

### 4. Final Classes
  - Classes which are prefixed final can stop subclasses which cannot inherit properties from super class
  - use final class as it is
